# SSL-Primary-Study
This project contains a first initial study for leveraging a SSL method called data augmentation in BPM.

All used event logs can be downloaded from https://data.4tu.nl/portal.

The project contains a Main class for demonstrating the reduction of event logs and a main class for demonstrating the augmentation functionality. 

The PythonInput class in the package ml generates all necessary files for training a LSTM neural network that is proposed
in the research paper:
