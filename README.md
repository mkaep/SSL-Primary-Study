# SSL-Primary-Study
This project contains a first initial study for leveraging a SSL method called data augmentation in BPM. Please note that the repository is regularly updated to provide new features and some bug fixes.

All used event logs can be downloaded from https://data.4tu.nl/portal. 

The project contains a Main class for demonstrating the reduction of event logs and a main class for demonstrating the augmentation functionality. For running the main classes the paths must be updated to the stored event logs.

The PythonInput class in the package ml generates all necessary files for training a LSTM neural network that is proposed
in the research paper:
